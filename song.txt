On the low
Only love myself, no more
Take you to the grave, I'll ghost
I know I can be so cold
In the dark
Where I like to keep my heart
Know I'm all bite, no bark
Like to catch you way off guard

Time to roll the dice, you know I'm the type
Type to risk my life, not afraid to die
Type to make you cry, type to put a price
All up on your head, do just what I said
I'm a straight up villain, straight up villain
Yeah, no feeling, yeah, no feeling
Straight up villain, straight up villain
Yeah, no feeling, yeah, no feeling
